    "While the purpose of Flaredown for it's users isn't about diagnosis, we would be remiss if we ignored the fact that we have a very solid training set for a system to perform diagnosis.  We will reshape the data so that our features are one-hotted symptoms, and we will predict on condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of algorithms out there that take a list of self reported symptoms and attempt a diagnosis.  But the depth and breadth of the ever-growing Flaredown data may provide new oppertunities for this task, especially since in the future Flaredown may collect any number of additional variables.\n",

    "I do recommend giving this some time before it's used.  At this time (Aug 22, 2016) the data only describes about 900 conditions.  For a diagnosis engine to be useful it is likely to require a huge breadth of conditions."
