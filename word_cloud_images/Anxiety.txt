swollen but slightly better crashed today after running on adrenaline since monday headaches still absent or mild since starting N but we'll see got a new mouse will hopefully fix my elbow problem Naltrexone still seems to be going well blood test bath brushed my teeth Sophia and Declan visited cut toenails claire sophia declan kate and hamish came over waaaaaaaaay overdid it kinda dying now also my stomach didn't like the frozen coke blood moon lol Visit from Kate and Hamish Visit from Declan visit from Josh cut my hair probably shouldn't have my energy and adrenaline have been weird today still haven't crashed properly from Dr Deed's appointment had a 16 hour sleep last night which was cool and i seem to be able to stay up longer without any issues instead of just the 12 hrs then crashing thanks naltrexone! didn't get a good sleep last night but hopefully will tonight, so hopefully tomorrow will be better Showered kind of dying from yesterday but had a rest day today big blood test feeling better now after the last two days of blood moon hell Massive stomach event not sure what caused it day 1 did the treatment thing too cut my nails and toenails Audrey, Dom, Esther, and Brendan came over finger still improving Audrey and Dom came over and we played lotr trivia so i'm kinda dead third day of arguing with Claire today was less intense than yesterday and the day before also i had a shower yesterday finished Keflex also chamomile is evil in every form some new myofacial pain just a bit though shaved my legs for the 2nd time this year lol some mild chest discomfort possibly lung-related Nay came over started Naltrexone!!! headache seemed to get better after N dunno tho Hamish's birthday pretty nasty day upping Naltrexone to 1mg alternating with 0.5 for two weeks stomach a bit off with Keflex did some metal stamping another massive kerfuffle with the siblings started Equilibrant claire debacle 2.0 a bit better bit of adrenaline from that 4th sickaversary hot day headache still seems to be mostly absent brushed my teeth yesterday cut half my nails today will try for a bath tomorrow did lots of cross stitch Dr Deed appointment headaches continue to be absent or mild which is awesome don't want to jump to hasty conclusions might be getting a cold had a sore-ish throat elbow getting worse getting a new mouse soon started cutting my nails odd day was dizzy for the first half i think it was a crash from going to the er but then i had a 7 hr nap, and i was good now 14 hrs later i'm going back to sleep chest pain is still gone day one of keflex nose thing a bit worse had to lie down more missed some vitamins cut my nails and toenails chest pain still went to emergency but they didn't think it was super concerning now i think it might be more muscular been there for about a day and a half maybe two days gonna try heat on it tonight, to see if that helps the muscles 2nd day on keflex had an argument with Josh very stressfull audrey came over a little better than yesterday my joints and muscles aren't so yikes had shower had an 18 hour sleep last night don't know where that came from esther came over! and i made a pincushion and posted my blog post on fb some really bad back pain had heat on it half the day ending the day with a bit of dizziness wow what a bad day found out my leave of absence got rejected stressed out about The Conversation with Claire tomorrow and apparently Josh will be visiting tomorrow too, along with Mars Whooo fun week kate and claire came over for The Conversation and then Josh came over later with Mars And so now i'm dead also my right jaw joint is really ouchy not sure what's causing it it's been slowly getting worse for about a week now i think If it's not better by monday i'll have to see a dr day after The Conversation ceiling fan installed watched Easter Parade not sure what my crash is doing i seem weirdly okay which probably means it will all blow up in my face soon yay a bit of stress also expecting the blood moon in the next day or two hot day, kind of melted lol she didn't brush my teeth tho day one yesterday plus lots of headaches and a bit of dizziness and today Kate and Josh came over mostly to talk about their opinions on the bathroom thing and i've had a few headaches today a bit of nausea and some abdo gas pain  nothing much happened today EXCEPT THE CACW TRAILER COMING OUT I DIED so i kinda died had a headache for a lot of today partly because i was dehydrated after a 16 hr sleep helped put up the christmas tree and did the tiny one in my room tried to talk to josh about all the stuff he said was fairly unsuccessful mostly only succeeded in getting stressed out today was a bit of a drag, until i realised i needed electrolytes now i'm fine had a smidge of the chest pain again but it only lasted a minute or so pretty rubbishy day got a bit better closer to the end though long day yesterday and then a long sleep so i was a bit dehydrated when i woke up and ive had a headache on and off all day with a bit of nervy nausea thrown in did a lot of cross stitch and some drawing was pretty dead for a bit after that but recovered okay also cut my nails finished cutting my nails cut my toenails the stats don't seem so bad bad still had a pretty bad day but* not as bad as last month though i don't think so that's something subluxed my left hip a bit but i got it back in fine muscles are still a bit sore though also Kate and Hamish came over washed my face and exfoliated that weird stabbing pain in my heel happened again idk what's with that and shaved my legs wrapped some presents christmas day went to mass first tried finbarrs then had to go to rosaliee then played mastermind and watched a movie with mum and dad christmas part 2: boxing day ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i kinda died did a whooooole lot of stuff, and will probably die tomorrow hope the payback isn't as bad as it probably will be woo pretty awful day but a bit better towards the end of it hopefully with another sleep, 12 hrs if i can get it, I'll be a fair bit better tomorrow better today than yesterday not much of a headache still a lot of fatigue but less muscle and joint pain plus a bit of dizziness, but not much stillllllllllllll recovering from Christmas nope might still be on the adrenaline run from christmas bit hard to tell though hopefully a long sleep tonight will end it anyway had a 21 hour sleep last night must have needed it bit of a better day better mood too think i miiiiiiight have recovered from christmas but i guess we'll see ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh worst reaction to the broth powder really awful nausea and a fever that almost made me pass out on the toilet so yeah, fun day oh and i had a nap had a shower! finally! and organised my cross stitch supplies shoulder was a bit sore again this morning must be sleeping on it funny and i got all psyched up thinking about the sibling situation yay adrenaline had a bit of a conversation with claire and kate which didn't go so well but i think i've found a solution but yeah i've been tense so my apetite's been rubbish Claire and Kate came over with the kids and it wasn't pretty more convos with Claire an email from kate and stayed awake wayyy too long 18 and a half hours apparently brushed my teeth finally lots of thinking sent apologies to kate and claire stayed up a bit long kinda died dead to start with but improved as the day went on and kind of died okay really kind of died a bit better after my crash from the shower and better since dropping back the equ did a semi bath and esther came over and did a bit of organizing suuuuuuper tired today heavy limbs etc pulse was a bit low at ~90 bpm blood pressure low too ~106 over 65 accidentally slept 19 hrs same

erin here also first day without the girls haven't properly crashed yet so waiting for that to happen starting to crash properly now also very hot day the cold pillow's working nicely tho crashing
