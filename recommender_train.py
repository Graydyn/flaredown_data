### Usage: python recommender_train.py datafile modeldir <pearson|cosine> threshold
### Sample: python recommender_train.py effectiveness_083016.csv models
### Sample: python recommender_train.py effectiveness_083016.csv models pearson 0.05

### This script takes in the pre-processed datafile from treatment_effectiveness.ipynb and measures the cosine distance
### between the effectiveness of all tags/treatments.  It then outputs a cosine distance table for each condition, which
### can be used by recommender_predict.py

### Before deciding on a distance metric, check out the accompanying notebook.  Long story short, you will find more
### non-na distances if you use cosine distance, but pearson is more discriminant.  If you set the
### distance metric to pearson, you can also set a p value to use as a threshold for significance.  At this time
### (August 31st, 2016) if you use pearson and set a p value threshold of 0.05 you will find 0 significant correlations.

### Don't be surprised by the amount of NaN in the model.  Only treatments/tags that have been used by the same user
### for the same condition will have a value.  This means that most values will be NaN.
