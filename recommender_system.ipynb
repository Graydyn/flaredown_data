    "## Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this document is to provide a way to recommend treatments to users.  For each condition, we can see what treatments have worked for other patients.  We can also go one step further and say, if Treatment/Tag A has worked for you, then other people who have had success with Treatment/Tag A have also had success with Treatment/Tag B.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same will also be possible in reverse.  Some Treatments/Tags may cause Conditions/Symptoms to worsen, and we may be able to recommend against those Treatments/Tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to say that a treatment is working, we need a measure of that.  There are a few strategies for doing that, so it's handled in a separate notebook \"treatment_effectiveness\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter Type\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a collaborative filter to make our recommendations, but there are two different types that we need to consider.  Item based filtering will form groups of associated items(in our case, an item is a treatment/tag), and recommend people who have good results with items in that set to other items in that set.  User based filtering will try to form groups of users that have success with similar items, and make recommendations based on what items work well for that group.  We will of course figure out which one is best for our situation by trying both.\n",

    "VERSION INFO : The user-based recommender below uses profile information which was added in the 083016 version of the datafile, use that one or later."

Correlation makes a great distance measure because it gives a p-value which can be used to assess how significant the distance measures are. Pearson correlation is a measure of how much a variable changes relative to another variable, divided by how much they change independently.  This will help us accomodate the fact that not all users will rate their symptoms the same.  Presumably, some users will consistently rate their symptoms as being worse than others."
