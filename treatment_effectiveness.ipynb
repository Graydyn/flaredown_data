    "Many of the analysis that we want to perform hinge on being able to determine which treatments or tags are having an effect on how a user feels.\n",
    "In this document we will go over a few different ways to measure this.\n",
    "There are two major challenges that we need to deal with.  First is that the effects that we are trying to measure may have unmeasured delays or cycles.  For example, a person who begins taking Synthroid for a thyroid condition is not expected to see improvement for several weeks.\n",
    "The second major challenge is that this data is inherently noisey.  The noise is expected from user reported data.  Nobody uses the app every single day, and may not give perfectly accurate representations of their symptoms.  We should also be aware that we may be dealing with some biases.  For example people who are drawn to use the app are likely suffering more than the average person, are more likely in a younger age group, and have likely already had some trouble with diagnosis."
